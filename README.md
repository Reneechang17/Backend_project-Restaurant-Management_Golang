Tailored to meet the diverse needs of various business sectors with a focus on scalability and ease of maintenance.
- 🌟REST APIs: 
Constructed with Gin, providing seamless create/read/update operations and handling complex workflows such as order processing and payment transactions.
- 🌟Advanced Data Management: 
Utilized MongoDB's aggregation features for efficient relationship mapping and advanced data analytics capabilities.
- 🌟Secure Authentication System: 
Integrated JWT for robust authentication, featuring secure token lifecycle management with generation, validation, and refresh functions.
- 🌟Enhanced System Resilience: 
Implemented comprehensive error handling and systematic logging, significantly boosting the reliability and traceability of the backend infrastructure.

## [Technologies Used🔧]
- 💻Programming Language: Go (Golang) for its concurrency support and performance efficiency.
- 📊Database: MongoDB and its advanced aggregation operation.
- 🔐Authentication: Utilize JWT for stateless authentication to ensure secure data access.
- 🛠️Server Framework: Gin for building the REST APIs with less boilerplate and high-performance.
