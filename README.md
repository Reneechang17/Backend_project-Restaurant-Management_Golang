### [Project Structure📂] 
![Project Structure Diagram](https://github.com/Reneechang17/Bistro-Ops-API/blob/main/static/go%20structure.jpg)
- controllers: Handle business logic for processing requests and returning responses
- models: Define the schema for database entities
- routes: Bind the HTTP methods and paths to controller actions
- middleware: Use for authentication that runs before/after controllers
- database: Set up database connection and configuration
- helpers: JWT token functions 

### [Key Features✅]
- 🌟Scalable Backend Architecture: Tailored to meet the diverse needs of complex business logics with a focus on scalability and ease of maintenance.
- 🌟REST APIs: Constructed with **Gin**, providing CURD operations and handling workflows such as order processing and payment transactions.
- 🌟Advanced Data Management: Utilized MongoDB's **aggregation** features for efficient relationship mapping.
- 🌟Secure Authentication System: Used **JWT** for authentication, featuring secure token lifecycle management with generation, validation, and refresh functions.
