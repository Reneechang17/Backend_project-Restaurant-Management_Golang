- controllers: Handle business logic for processing requests and returning responses
- models: Define the schema for database entities
- routes: Bind the HTTP methods and paths to controller actions
- middleware: Use for authentication that runs before/after controllers
- database: Set up database connection and configuration
- helpers: Some shared code and reuse functions 

## [Key Features✅]

- 🌟REST APIs: Constructed with **Gin**, providing CURD operations and handling workflows such as order processing and payment transactions.
- 🌟Advanced Data Management: Utilized MongoDB's **aggregation** features for efficient relationship mapping.
- 🌟Secure Authentication System: Used **JWT** for authentication, featuring secure token lifecycle management with generation, validation, and refresh functions.


## [Technologies Used🔧]
- 💻 Programming Language: Go (Golang) for its concurrency support and performance efficiency.
- 📊 Database: MongoDB and its advanced aggregation operation.
- 🔐 Authentication: Utilize JWT for stateless authentication to ensure secure data access.
- 🛠️ Server Framework: Gin for building the REST APIs with high-performance.
